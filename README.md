Projects
🔍 Image Search Engine Using CNN
(Content-Based Image Retrieval System)
A deep-learning–powered image search engine that retrieves visually similar images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Instead of relying on metadata or tags, the system analyzes image content to generate feature embeddings, enabling fast and accurate similarity matching across large datasets.
Key Highlights:
•	CNN-based feature extraction for semantic image understanding
•	High-performance similarity search using vector embeddings
•	Scalable architecture suitable for large image datasets
•	Supports real-world use cases such as visual product search and image recommendation
Technologies:
CNNs, Deep Learning, Feature Embeddings, HTML, Python

📄 Chaty_PDFs
AI-Powered Chatbot for Document Interaction
Chaty_PDFs is an intelligent chatbot that allows users to chat with PDF documents instead of manually reading them. The system extracts text from PDFs, converts it into vector embeddings, and stores it in ChromaDB for fast semantic search. Users can ask natural-language questions and receive context-aware answers.
Key Highlights:
•	PDF text extraction and semantic indexing
•	Vector database integration using ChromaDB
•	Context-aware question answering
•	Ideal for education, research, and document analysis
Technologies:
Python, NLP, Embeddings, ChromaDB, HTML, AI Chatbot Architecture
